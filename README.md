# rust-webrtc-sfu-unity
This is a webrtc-sfu server intended to be integrated for [com.unity.webrtc](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.webrtc). This repo's source is mostly based on [binbat](https://github.com/binbat)'s [live777](https://github.com/binbat/live777) and [webrtc-rs](https://github.com/webrtc-rs/webrtc), but modified for use in a multiplayer game. This uses trickle ice for peerconnection.
